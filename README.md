### Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)  and Sofware engeneering Enthusiast 

I'm a passionate developer focused on building intelligent systems, deploying scalable ML models, and writing clean, efficient code. I'm particularly interested in MLOps‚Äîbridging the gap between ML development and production operations.

üî≠ **I‚Äôm currently working on:** My Book Recommendation System project, with a focus on MLOps practices for deployment and monitoring..
üå± **I‚Äôm currently learning:** MLOps tools and best practices, alongside advanced Java and Machine Learning fundamentals.
üëØ **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on:** Open-source MLOps and ML projects.
üí¨ **Ask me about:** MLOps, Python, Java, Data Structures, Frontend developer skills and Algorithms.
üì´ **How to reach me:** [naguepascal5@gmail.com](mailto:naguepascal5@gmail.com)
‚ö° **Fun fact:** I love solving complex problems with elegant code , especially when it involves automating ML pipelines.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Projects

- **[Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/NPCabrel/book-recommender)** - A Java-based engine suggesting books based on co-occurrence patterns.
- **[Python skills](https://github.com/NPCabrel/miniProjects)** - These are some projects, i coded to involved my knowledge in Python.
- **[NotesCalculator](https://github.com/NPCabrel/NotesCalculatorFlask.git)** - This is a small project to improve my skills in Python Tools like Pandas and usability of a csv file
